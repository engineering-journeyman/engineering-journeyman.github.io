# What is an Engineering Journeyman?

I coined the term "Engineering Journeyman" to describe a software engineer that is comfortable and proficient in the trade but recognizes the value of continuous education, experience, and growth.

The term "Journeyman" comes from medieval crafting guilds. These guilds, among other things, were responsible for establishing standards for their respective trade and would typically rank their member artisans as either apprentice, journeyman, or master. An apprentice was someone who had set out to become an artisan in their chosen craft, but was learning and gaining experience under a master. A journeyman was an artisan that had successfully completed their apprenticeship, having proven their proficiency in the trade to the extent that they could do the work without supervision. A journeyman was no longer bound to a master and could choose their work. The original meaning of the word "journey" was "daily", referring to the journeyman's right to charge for the day's work. A master was one who had authority and, as you would expect, had mastered the craft.

I think the word "journeyman" describes me well and though the word "journey" may have had a different meaning then than it does now, I believe its modern meaning applies well to software engineering. To me, the world of software engineering represents a lifetime of potential and expansion. I view life in general as a journey and life is no fun to me without something to work toward. This is part of what draws me to software engineering. I'm sure someday, some may view me as a master of my craft, but to me, I will always be a journeyman, always working toward my next goal, learning more all the time. I wouldn't be satisfied with anything less.

# Is the Engineering Journeyman Blog for You?

Definitely! Whether you consider yourself an apprentice, a journeyman, or a master, I believe there is always value in learning from the experience and perspective of others. My goal with this blog is to share the software engineering lessons I learn each week to help my associates in the community learn from those same lessons.

My name is Tanner Taylor. I'm a software engineer and the self-proclaimed "Engineering Journeyman". I've been a professional software engineer since 2016, but started my software engineering journey in high school. My dad has had a long career in information technology and had a leftover Java text book from his college years. I stumbled across it and was curious, so I started reading. Prior to this point, I hadn't even spared any thought to how someone might build a computer program, but strangely enough, I was hooked! I kept reading and started coding what I was learning. It didn't take me long to realize that this was what I wanted to do with my life.

I started going to college at Utah State University for a degree in Computer Science. While I was in school, I was working for a utility billing company called Conservice. The job I was doing at the time was nuanced and complicated with data and processes composed of dozens of spreadsheets. Let's just say it was in dire need of streamlining. It wasn't much, but I started automating the processes by scripting in Excel and Google Sheets. Eventually this grew into a suite of macros and scripts used by the team at large and eventually by other teams as well. It did well enough that performance numbers were improving and hiring projections went down. They had me working on this almost full time when a chief officer for the company took notice and got me moved over to the company's development team. It was not long after that I transfered to Western Governors University to study software development online.

After working on their development team for about two years and having just completed my degree two years ahead of schedule, I was ready to move on to something more exciting and challenging. I got the job I have now as a software engineer at a robotics company called ASI, working on their command and control software, Mobius, specifically for mining automation of loading, haulage, blasting, etc.

I've learned so much between these jobs and I continue to learn more every day. It is these lessons that I want to share with readers. I figure that if they provide this much value to me, perhaps they can be just as valuable to others.
